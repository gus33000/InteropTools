                <Run>This software through the Remote Access feature also serves as a local only server for other devices on your network to connect to the app instance. This server is local only, and is only used to provide api access (such as Registry) to the other app instance running on another device locally on the same network. Any attempt to connect to the app will preceed by a permission popup on the destination device with the local server running asking if you want to allow the connection from the remote computer (of which IP address is displayed). The data transfered with remote access is local only and won't be collected online by HockeyApp or any other service.</Run>
